# AdventOfCode2023
This repository contains my solutions to Advent of Code 2023. I have chosen to solve those problems using Go (and learn it in the process). I may solve some problems with C/C++ if I feel like it. If a problem will prove too hard to solve with those (since I do not know them all that great) I will probably default to Python.
